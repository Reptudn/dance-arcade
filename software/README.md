# Software

this will be the game and for now i try to write it completely native with SDL and so on for linux (because i plan to run the arcade on a lightweight linux maybe even on a raspi)

## How to build?

1. Navigate to the build folder (if not created then create one)
2. run cmake ..
3. run make
4. start with ./ddr
